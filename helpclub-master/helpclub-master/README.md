#Intelligent Farming on Wheels






The basic idea of the project is to decrease the burden on the farmers.It is a farmer-friendly prototype.
The main purpose is to serve the plant by providing the sufficient amount of water.Its major advantage is  vehicle movement can be controlled by basic instructions which is understandable to the farmer,the temperatre and humidity sensing is done and its outputs or measured value can be seen in a graphical way.
ADDITIONAL IDEAS:-
This vehicle is compatible for image sensing which is the important part of AI.
Disease recognition is one of the important factor that helps machine to predect and detect the disease depending up on the condition of the plant.This is an idea from our side to enhance that a simple,small and economical things can even help number of poor farmers.

The code is given above. clone the repostery to the working directory. 


To use code add folders 
test_images
training_images


train it by running commend "python retrain.py"
add atleast 10 images in each dataset in "training_images"  folder
recommend atlest two dataset

to test it by running commend "python test.py"
